  BUD_Event_Dealing_With_Greece.1.t: "Dealing With Greece"
  BUD_Event_Dealing_With_Greece.1.d: "Greece seems very unhappy with the sudden takeover of it's islands by us. We've received multiple requests for talks between us to figure out what is going on, and maybe even work out some sort of deal. On one hand, having Greece as a potential ally, or at least, not an immediate enemy, could be beneficial. On the other hand, do we really need, or even want to ally them in the first place?"
  BUD_Event_Dealing_With_Greece.1.a: "Shut down any requests for talks, the islands are ours."
  BUD_Event_Dealing_With_Greece.1.b: "Let's see what they have to say..."
  BUD_Event_Compromise.1.t: "Compromising with Greece"
  BUD_Event_Compromise.1.d: "Our talks with Greece have concluded, and we've come up with three options. We can become Greece's puppet, give Greece access to the resources available on the islands, or enter a defence pact with Greece. So, which is it?"
  BUD_Event_Compromise.1.a: "Give Greece the islands' resources"
  BUD_Event_Compromise.1.b: "Sign a pact with Greece"
  BUD_Event_Compromise.1.c: "Become Greece's puppet"
